Vortex Shedding (2D, Transient)

This is a common benchmark problem in fluid-structure interaction problems [1]. 


 - Objective: Determine the effect of changes in Reynold's number (between 0 and 100) on drag coefficient at the final timestep
 - Experimental data: Previous literature [1-4]
 - Numerical model: Implemented in Elmer FEM/FlowSolve Solver [5]
 - Data Analysis: Centered parameter study [6] performed using Dakota
 - Results: Numerical model predictions were in good agreement with the analytical model, max. discrepancy - 3% (refer to results.jpg)
