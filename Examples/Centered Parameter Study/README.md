Vortex Shedding (2D, Transient)

This is a common benchmark problem in fluid-structure interaction problems [1].

 - Boundary conditions: inlet (parabolic fully developed laminar velocity profile), no-slip walls and outlet (vertical component equal to zero). 
 
 - Data analysis: Centered parameter study (CPS)
   https://dakota.sandia.gov/sites/default/files/docs/6.10/html-ref/method-centered_parameter_study.html
   
 - Input parameter: Reynold's number (by varying the maximum velocity at the cylinder inlet) -- between 0 and 100.
 
 - Output parameter: Drag coefficient (determined using simulation output, Drag force in Newtons) --final timestep
 
 - The results from this study were in good agreement (max. discrepancy - 3%) with literature data [1 - 4].
