Vortex Shedding (2D, Transient)

This is a common benchmark problem in fluid-structure interaction problems [1]. A sampling study was conducted -- Reynold's number vs drag force. Reynold's number was varied by modifying maximum velocity at the inlet [2].Drag force at the final time step was extracted from the simulation results. The results from this study matched well (max. discrepancy: 3%) with literature data [1 - 4].
