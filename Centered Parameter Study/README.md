Vortex Shedding (2D, Transient)

This is a common benchmark problem in fluid-structure interaction problems. 
For more details on the problem, please refer to  -- 
Turek, S., & Sch√§fer, M. (1996). Recent benchmark computations of laminar flow
around a cylinder.


A sampling study was conducted -- Reynold's number vs drag force 

Reynold's number was varied by modifying maximum velocity at the inlet [1].

Drag force at the final time step was extracted from the simulation results.
