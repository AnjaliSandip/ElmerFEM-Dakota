This program, Elmer FEM-Dakota interface, is released under license GNU GENERAL
PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007.

Open-source electromagnetic design software, Elmer FEM, was interfaced with data analytics toolkit, Dakota. 
Furthermore, the coupled software was validated against a benchmark test.  The program along with benchmark test and other examples have been provided.
The interface programâ€™s primary application area is electromagnetics, but it can be easily extended to other multi-physics applications such as thermo-mechanics, fluid-structure interactions, etc.

Capabilities:
The interface developed provides a unified open-source computational framework for electromagnetics and data analytics.  
Its key features include uncertainty quantification, surrogate modeling and parameter studies.  
This framework enables a richer understanding of model predictions to better design electric machines in a time sensitive manner.
