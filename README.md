This program, Elmer FEM-Dakota interface, is released under license GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007. It is maintained by Anjali Sandip.


An interface program for 2 way coupling between open-source electromagnetic design software, Elmer FEM, and data analytics toolkit, Dakota, has been developed.
Furthermore, the coupled software was validated against a benchmark test.  The program along with benchmark test and other examples have been provided.
The interface programâ€™s primary application area is electromagnetics, but it can be easily extended to other multi-physics applications such as thermo-mechanics, fluid-structure interactions, etc.

Capabilities:
The program integrates the capabilities of electromagnetic design software, Elmer FEM, and data analytics toolkit, Dakota. Its key features include uncertainty quantification, surrogate modeling and parameter studies.  This framework enables a richer understanding of model predictions to better design electric machines in a time sensitive manner.

About: The interface program is written in bash and can be run in serial or parallel.  It uses functionality from the underlying packages.  The program was developed to integrate Dakota version 6.10 with Elmer FEM version 8.1.   It can be extended to other versions of Elmer FEM and Dakota with minor modifications.
